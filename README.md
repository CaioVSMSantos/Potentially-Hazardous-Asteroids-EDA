# Potentially-Hazardous-Asteroids-EDA
The objective of this project is to get familiar with the tools and libraries commonly used in Data Science projects and to freely explore the Asteroid Data provided by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in order to obtain insights about it. Although I have an intermediate knowledge of Astronomy, many of the details regarding Asteroids are unknown to me.
